<h3>Breakin</h3>

    <p>
        Breakin is a childhood favorite of mine. It was my introduction to hip-hop. It embodies the culture; by displayin graffiti, rap, style, and break dancing which was not well recived by the masses in the early 80's. Breakin and movies alike paved the way for hip-hop culture and proved that this lifestyle would transcend trends and become a part of societal agriculture.</p>

<h3>The Color Purple</h3> 

    <p>The Color Purple is a movie that gives a voice to the victims of misgony, racism, colorism, sexual,and physical abuse during a white patriachal time in American culture. It shows the perseverence and tenacity that many black women used to survive and empower themselves during a gross period of human development. </p>
